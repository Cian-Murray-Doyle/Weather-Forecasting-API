# Weather-Forecasting-API
A wine company needs a 3-day forecast to see which of there vineyards are at risk of freezing

#Introduction to the Problem
Vino Veritas is a winemaker that uses a manual system for predicting frost. This involves getting a 3-day forecast for the minimum temperature in vineyards around the world. The task of getting this data is relatively quick, but must be done every day, including weekends.

Last season, one small error led to a delayed warning for low temperatures in 2 vineyards. This led to a costly drop in yields for those vineyards in that season resulting in an estimated loss of $65,000. This was a huge shock for Vino Veritas and they now realize that they need to change to a more reliable, automated system.

Youâ€™ve been hired to manage this process and eliminate the risk of failed weather warnings in the future.
